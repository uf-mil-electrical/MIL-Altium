# Your one-stop Altium shop!
Welcome to the MIL-Altium repo. This repo contains plenty of resources for your Altium projects. A summary of each folder is provided below.

## Guides
This folder contains walkthroughs for different things you'll have to do in Altium.

## Part Libraries
This folder contains the components you should use for any MIL PCB project. If there's a part you need that isn't already in the library, add it in! The instructions for doing so will be created soon...

## Rules & Stackups
This folder contains design rules and board layer stackups. You should always import the design rules and choose which stackup you want to use (2-layer or 4-layer).

## Templates
This folder contains templates for use in your projects. Want to use a certain microcontroller? Copy and paste its template schematic from here into your own project folder to get started.
